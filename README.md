# laravel-consent

## Introduction

Laravel Consent is a middleware to automate some aspects of roles 
and permissions checking and is meant to work alongside [spatie permissions](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission)

It was developed to help transition from the [Yii Rbac](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/security-authorization) system
to Laravel.

It provides for automated role/permission checking on route names,
along with helpers to create permissions for those route names.
